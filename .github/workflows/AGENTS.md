## Version Alignment

Keep Bun versions aligned with:
- `.bun-version`

## Rules

- Use repo's `bun`-based commands; do not add Node setup steps
- Production build: `docker build .`
- Never commit secrets

## Common Tasks

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run test:integration  # needs DATABASE_URL
bun run test:e2e          # needs build
docker build .
```
