# Testing

## Current State
No automated test framework is currently configured in this repository.

## Single Test Runs
Single-test execution is not available until a test runner is added.

## What To Do Instead
- Use `bun run check` to run Biome linting checks.
- Use `bun run check --write` to auto-fix lint issues.
- Use `bun run format` for formatting only.
