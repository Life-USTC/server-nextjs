## Key Rules

### homework/
- Attached to section, not user
- Signed-in, unsuspended can create/update
- Delete: creator or admin only
- Completion is per-user, separate from entity

### todos/
- Purely personal
- User owns CRUD
- Due date → calendar (if incomplete)

### comments/
- Scoped to section/course/teacher/homework
- Visibility: public, logged-in, anonymous
- Suspended can't create
- Admin can moderate

### uploads/
- Comment attachments
- Pending-upload flow
- Check permissions for downloads

### bus/
- Public timetable
- Signed-in preference save
- Import idempotent by version
